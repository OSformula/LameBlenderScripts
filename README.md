# LameBlenderScripts
idk what you lookin for

* **mirror_L_and_fuse**: Grabs all shapekeys that end with ".L", duplicates+mirrors them renaming those to ".R" and creates another that fuses both variations a-la-MMD where you would have "joy.L", "joy.R" and "joy" (which is joy.R+joy.L). Created at 1:26 AM with no python OR blender API knowledge so it's just unoptimized as heck.
